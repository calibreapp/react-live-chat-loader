## ‚ûï Adding a Provider

To contribute a new provider, follow these steps:

### 1. Create provider file

Create a new provider file at `src/providers/providerName.js` using the
following as a template:

<details>
<summary>Provider Template</summary>

```js
const domain = 'https://provider.domain.com'

const loadScript = () => {
  // Detect the provider is already loaded and return early
  if (alreadyLoaded) return

  // Call provider script here
}

const load = ({ providerKey }) => {
  loadScript()
  // Initialise provider script
}

const open = () => // Open provider
const close = () => // Close provider

export default {
  domain,
  load,
  open,
  close
}
```

</details>

The provider must export the following:

- `domain`: A string of the domain where the provider script is loaded from
  that will be used in a `preconnect` link.
- `load`: Function which when called will load and initialize the provider
  script. It should accept props and use the `providerKey` as the `app_id` or
  `api_key`. For consistency, it should call a `loadScript` function.
- `open`: Function which when called will open the provider chat.
- `close`: Function which when called will close the provider chat.

Import the new file in `src/providers/index.js` and add it to `Providers`.

The name of this file will be the `providerKey` used in the
`LiveChatLoaderProvider`.

### 2. Create component

Create a new component in `src/Components/ProviderName/index.js` which
replicates the chat widget, using the following as a template:

<details>
<summary>Component Template</summary>

```jsx
import React from 'react'

import { useChat } from '../../'
import STATES from '../../utils/states'

const styles = {
  // Add widget styles here
  button: {
    // Add button styles here
  }
}

const Provider = ({ color }) => {
  const [state, loadChat] = useChat({ loadWhenIdle: true })

  if (state === STATES.COMPLETE) return null

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={() => loadChat({ open: true })}
        onMouseEnter={() => loadChat({ open: false })}
        style={{
          ...styles.button,
          backgroundColor: color
        }}
      >
        Button
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

Provider.defaultProps = {
  color: '#976ad4'
}

export default Provider
```

</details>

Do not worry about loading animations as the widget
will be shown instantly on page load. Increase the `z-index` by `1` so the fake
widget sits immediately above the chat widget that is being replaced.

Export the component from `src/index.js`

### 3. Update README

Add your new provider to this README under [Supported Providers](README.md#-supported-providers).

### 4. Add an example page

Add a new page to `website/pages/` which showcases the provider. If you don't want to include your `providerKey` leave this blank and the maintainers will set one up.

The new provider page can be tested locally by creating a distribution version of the package and referencing this from the `website`.

To create the distribution version and reference it, do the following:

- In the root of the project, run `npm run build`
- In the `website` directory run `npm install`
- In the `website` directory run the server with `npm run dev`
- Add a new page to `website/pages/` which includes the new component
- Add a link to the provider in `website/pages/index.js`
- Add a link to the provider in `website/components/exampleLinks.js`
